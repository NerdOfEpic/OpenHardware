# OpenHardware
Open source hardware designs.

This is a collection of free open sourced PCBs that I've designed for various purposes.
At this time they are primarily for breadboard work and for adapting Raspberry Pi to Arduino 
voltages.

These designs have been shown to work as expected by having them made and tested with 
an oscilloscope and on breadboards, but that doesn't mean they are perfect or won't be 
revised in the future.

**All of these designs are available for direct purchase through PCBWay**

Head over to https://www.pcbway.com/project to find them.  (Better link will be available soon.)

**Notes:**
- Some of these SMD components and at least one uses a _LOT_ of them.  
- All SMD components use "hand solder" pads and at least 0805 sized parts to make 
soldering them by hand easier.
- You should consider purchasing them fully assembled if you are not comfortable soldering 
SMD components.

**Each board includes:**
- A zip file with the latest gerber files already prepared.  This can be downloaded and 
sent to your favorite PCB manufacturing service without the need for any additional software.
- A complete KiCad 5.x project with schematics and PCB design.  
- Some boards require the NerdConsole_Common parts library.
